# Slack Intro

You should have received an email invitation to join a slack workspace for our class. Accept the invitation and say hi in the discussion channel.

Slack is very easy and intuitive. Each class will decide on the channels and communication standards.

If you want to communicate privately with the instructor, or any person in the class, just select their name in the Direct message section and post the message there.
