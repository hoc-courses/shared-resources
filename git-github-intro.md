### What is a Version Control System?

A really helpful analogy is a video game. You get to a certain point in the game, and you don't want to lose your current place and have to start over if you die. So you save your game. If something bad happens after that point you can always reload your game and start from that point again. 

This is exactly what happens in a version control system, except that it is called **committing your changes**, instead of saving your game. A change is any code modification\(s\) made since the last commit.

### What is a Repository?

A Repository, or repo, is the collection of files that make up a single project that you would like to have tracked for changes.

### What is git?

**git** is a free and open source, distributed version control system. Git is designed to work with a repository on your local computer. The core functionality allows you to manage and keep track of changes to the collection of files in your repository over time. 

Internet access, or collaboration with other developers, is not required. Git does support sharing repositories with others across the internet, but at its core, **its primary focus is source code control in a local repository**.

### What is GitHub?


Typically, within a development environment, collaboration is integral to the project, and there is a need to have a centralized location for the repository where developers share their work and can ensure automatic backups. This is where **GitHub** comes in.

**GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you store and manage git repositories, and is the most popular solution used by software developers to work collaboratively on software projects.  **GitHub** is know as the place where the development community shares open source projects (the code is accessible and can be used by anyone). 

**GitHub** is free until you need more advanced features. There are other sites, such as **Bitbucket**, that provide similar services, but they focus more on meeting the needs of companies that want their repositories to be private and provide added tools for a paid members.

### Why do you Need a Version Control System?

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbZf3lPMOYY&list=PLVYDhqbgYpYXbAL\_Hps1Y--THRmaTFipj&index=9) provides a very good overview of why individuals, and/or teams use a version control system.
